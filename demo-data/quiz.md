9. Which photo and explanation BEST describe the preferred and safest way to set-up a hot glue gun in the Design Den?
Mark only one option.
- Option 1 - I'm on the floor close to the outlet, mostly out of the way and I have hot glue gun is resting on paper.
- Option 2 - I carefully used an extension cord to reach from the
nearest outlet and up on to the table. The cord for my hot glue gun is just hanging there but it seems safe as long as no one catches their foot on the extension and pulls the hot glue gun off the table.
- Option 3 - I'm working right by where the hot glue guns and extra glue is kept. There are globs of glue on top of the cart but who cares its card board and it looks like other people did it so it MUST be okay. Plus I'm super close to Mr. Cribbs if I need to ask a question.
- Option 4 - I have paper under my hot glue gun to catch any drips. I've plugged the hot glue gun into a power strip that is on top of the table so others can use hot glue guns on the table too. For extra safety I wrapped the power strip cord in case any one catches their foot underneath the hot glue gun shouldn't go flying.
- Option 5 - I have paper for my hot glue gun to catch drips and wrapped my extension cord around the table leg so the hot glue gun shouldn't fly off if someone trips.
